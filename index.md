# About Me

> _Iâ€™m a true hacker. I deeply research what attracts my attention to know how it works and how it can be used curiously. Doesn't matter if it's things, computer programs or even people._

Currently I'm looking for applying my skills and knowledge to machine-human interaction/symbiosis. So I doing some projects related to digital health and noninvasive interconnection/sensing human neural system. I can fairly free do it because I have experience and solid knowledge in programming all things from bare metal to cloud services and I skilled enough in electronics to make my own hardware or reverse existing. Also I learn psychlogy, human biology and neuroscince to understand how, why and what I need to do for achive my goals.
