> _Iâ€™m a true hacker. I deeply research what attracts my attention to know how it works and how it can be used curiously. Doesn't matter if it's things, computer programs or even people._

To research something interesting me I often do tiny pet projects. Sometimes it becomes not so tiny. 

Currently I looking to applying my skills and knowledge in machine-human interaction/symbiosis. So I doing some projects related to noniuasive intercaonnection/sensing with human neural system and digital healthcare. It means I making both my own hardware and firmware for existing common hardware like fitnes wristbands. 

Scince human neural system and body are variating from one to other it also requires good knowledge in machile learning and data mining. So another things I learning and practice in: applied Artifitial Intelligence and common Data Scince.
