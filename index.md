# About Me

> _I’m a true hacker. I research in deep stuff that attracts my attention to learn how it works and how it can be used in unusual way. It дoesn't matter if it's about things, computer software or even people._


Currently I'm looking to apply my skills and knowledge to machine-human interaction/symbiosis. So I'm doing some projects related to digital health and non-invasive interconnection/sensing human neural system. I can do this fairly free since I have experience and solid knowledge in programming all things from bare metal to cloud services, and I'm skilled enough in electronics to make my own hardware or reverse existing one. I also study psychlogy, human biology and neuroscience, to understand how, why, and what I need to do to achieve my goals.



# My Projects

To research something interesting to me I often do a tiny pet project. Sometimes it becomes not so tiny ;). I have a lot of pet projects, and not all of them are presented in my github. By the way you can simply look in my GitHub profile to find more. Here are some of the last projects related to my current interests.
