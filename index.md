# About
> _Iâ€™m a true hacker. I deeply research what attracts my attention to know how it works and how it can be used curiously. Doesn't matter if it's things, computer programs or even people._

To research something interesting me I often do tiny pet projects. Sometimes it becomes not so tiny. 

Currently I looking for applying my skills and knowledge in machine-human interaction/symbiosis. So I doing some projects related to noninvasive interconnection/sensing human neural system and also related to digital health. It means I make not only PC software but both my own hardware and firmware for existing common hardware like fitnes wristbands. 

Scince human neural system, phisiology, behaviour and mentality are variating from one to other it also requires good knowledge in machine learning and data mining. So another things I learn and practice in are applied Artifitial Intelligence and common Data Scince.
